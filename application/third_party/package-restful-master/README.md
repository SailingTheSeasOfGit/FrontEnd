# package-restful

Phil Sturgeon's (old) REST server libraries & controller, packaged for CodeIgniter.

To use, copy the source into your project, so that "restful" ends up inside the 
"third_party" folder of your application.

Then add the package path to your config/.autoload...
    
    $autoload['packages'] = array(APPPATH.'third_party/restful/');

Proper docs coming soon :-/
